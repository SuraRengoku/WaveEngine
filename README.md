## Overview

**WaveEngine** is a self-built C++ engine project aimed at exploring modern real-time rendering techniques and scalable engine architecture.  
The project covers both core engine systems and supporting tools, designed for learning, experimentation, and long-term development.

Key goals:
- Modular engine architecture  
- Real-time rendering pipeline  
- High-performance C++ design  
- Toolchain and editor integration  
- Research-oriented graphics features

✅ Core engine framework 
✅ Window and input system
✅ Rendering context abstraction (D3D12)
⏳ Material and shader system
⏳ PBR rendering pipeline
⏳ Real-time shadow mapping
⏳ Scene editor integration
